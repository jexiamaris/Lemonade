## Business Activities
* Lemonade Insurance Company is transforming the very business model of insurance. By injecting technology and transparency into an industry that often lacks both, it is creating an insurance experience that is fast, affordable, and hassle free. Unlike any other insurance company, it gain nothing by delaying or denying claims (it take a flat fee!), so it handle and pay as many claims instantly as possible. It currently offer renters, homeowners, and pet health insurance.

* The advantage of Lemonade over its competitors is a fast and easy process to get an insurance. The company has an user-friendly app Maya, an artificial intelligence bot where customers within minutes can get an insurance. In addition, traditional insurance companies make money by keeping the money they don’t pay out in claims. This is why getting your claims paid fast and in full is sometimes so hard. Lemonade was built differently. In essence, the company treats premiums as if they were still your money and return unclaimed remainders in our annual 'Giveback' which is a unique feature of Lemonade, where each year leftover money is donated to causes our policyholders care about. Furthermore, Lemonade takes a flat fee.
* Lemonade is fully powered by artificial intelligence and behavioral economics. It uses bots, software that automatically performs simple tasks, to deliver insurance through its app and at lemonade.com. Consumers also file claims with the bot, which is authorized to pay claims instantly and without human intervention, creating an “delightful” insurance experience for customers which are often compelled to share the experience on social media. Lemonade's technology includes Application and Data (Python, NGINX, CloudFlare, TypeScript, Rails, Go, Swift, OpenResty, and Ruby), Utilities (Google Analytics, Mixpanel, Mandrill, and Segment), DevOps (Docker), Business Tools (WordPress, G Suite, and Medium).

## Landscape
* Financial Industry: Lemonade is in Financial Services, sector Insurance- Property and Casualty.
* Trends and Innovations: the purpose of insurance has remained the same over the years but new innovations in technology and processes are transforming the industry, such as:
  - Big Data: where insurers use more and more sources of information to gain a deeper insight into the risk they're covering, has huge benefits. As well as more accurate underwriting and pricing, a deeper understanding of customers can also drive more personalized product development and marketing.
  - Blockchain: is a mutual distributed ledger system. This enables multiple parties to share the same information, without the need for validation from an intermediary. Another key benefit is that it is virtually impossible to hack. Some of the first examples of its application in the sector include providing insurance to sharing economy platforms but it also has the potential to streamline paperwork and deliver efficiencies in the claims process.
  - Internet: the insurance sector is set to benefit from Internet connectivity, as well as enabling the provision of new services, in many areas this will shift the focus from repair to prevention.
  - Drones: are delivering huge benefits in claims management. In situations such as fires or floods where it's not possible for a claims adjustor to gain immediate access, a drone can be flown over the property to determine the extent of the damage. As well as resulting in improvements in customer service due to the speed at which this service can be delivered, repairs can also get started much sooner.
  - Artificial Intelligence: the volume of data available within the insurance sector makes it a prime candidate for artificial intelligence (AI). Already there are examples of insurers using more sophisticated machine learning analytics to support their staff in areas ranging from social media analysis to pricing and claims.
* Competitors: principal competitors are SURE, Slice, Trov, Geico, and State Farm.

## Results
* Lemonade has great impact in the insurance business since is a pioneer in the InsurTech world where its use of machine learning (ML) goes beyond satisfying customers and driving efficiencies to underwriting risks and managing claims. Lemonade’s business model is based on a transparent fee model, fast claim settlement, and social good. The usage of AI significantly improves processes in insurance as it increases underwriting precision improving premium pricing accuracy, enhances customer experience through fast paper-free processes, and lowers claims costs by reducing fraud. In claims settlement, Lemonade’s artificial intelligence assesses the claim by cross-referencing home information, compares it to the customer’s policy, runs fraud algorithms, and finally approves or rejects a claim. The whole process takes up to three minutes and is approved within seconds.
* These are some of the core metrics that insurance companies use to measure success:
  - Revenue per policyholder: measures the amount of revenue generated by the insurance company, per policyholder serviced.
  - Average cost per claim: measures how much a company pays out for each claim filed bi its customers.
  - Average time to settle a claim: measures how long it takes on average to settle insurance claims for each type of policy the company offer.
  - Return on surplus: shows how much profit an insurance company can bring in relative to the amount of revenue it generates.
  - Loss ratio: measures the total amount of claims paid out to policyholders by the insurance company as a percentage of total premium earned over the same period.
  - Components of claim cost: tracks the cost involved with significant controllable elements of claims, such as legal cost, report delays, and time to settle.
* Lemonade is growing exponentially and its performance is great. the company's technology makes the measure these metrics faster, so it can prevent and respond quickly. In the case of revenue per policyholder Lemonade has a flat fee of 20% its policies, so the revenue grow with the amount if subscribers. For average cost per claim, average time to settle a claim, loss ratio, and components of claim cost metrics Lemonade uses its technology, with its artificial intelligence and business model claims are pay out quickly and its prevent fraud. For return on surplus Lemonade uses its surplus for charity causes that its policyholders supports. 
* The key elements for Lemonade's growth is that the company communicates its fee structure with its customers to achieve trustworthiness and transparency; two attributes missing in the insurance industry. Therefore, Lemonade is growing faster and performing above its competitors.

## Recommendation
* A Recommendation for Lemonade is to start offering car insurance. This new service would benefit the growth of the company, as well as gain new marketshare since the current customers would add car insurance to their policy. On the other hand, Lemonade already had the technology for car insurance service, its artificial intelligence. Lemonade’s AI is an appropriate technology for this service since the general process of the policy could be similar and could be adapt to car insurance service.
